This is djbdns-1.04-fwdzone. By Laurent Bercot <ska@idealx.com>

 You may download, copy, use, modify and redistribute this patch under
EXACTLY the same terms as djbdns. You don't have to get in touch with
me to redistribute modified versions of this patch, but I'd like you to
let me know. Thanks.


 Instructions :

 * Compile and install djbdns.

 * The FORWARDONLY environment variable doesn't work anymore. By default,
dnscache performs only iterative queries, like in pre-1.03 versions.

 * Configure the root/servers directory of dnscache :
   echo dns.server > my.iterative.zone

   echo dns.cache > my.recursive.zone
   chmod +t my.recursive.zone

  If my.zone has the sticky bit set, dnscache will perform recursive queries
for the zone : my.zone must contain a list of DNS caches to whom dnscache
will forward the queries.
  If my.zone has the sticky bit cleared, dnscache will perform iterative
queries for the zone : my.zone must contains a list of appropriate DNS
servers.

 If @ has the sticky bit set, dnscache will forward any queries it cannot
find a preconfigured zone for. This is most useful behind a firewall with
a split-DNS configuration.
